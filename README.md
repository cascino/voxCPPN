# voxCPPN
Generative CPPN-like neural network with latent vectors for voxel shape encoding/generation.
The main network is a small CPPN-like feedforward neural network that encodes binary voxel shapes. The input to the net 
is (x, y, z, radius, latent) and the output is the probability of a voxel at that position. Each shape the network encodes is assigned a latent vector, creating a traversable search space of data in between the encoded voxel shapes.
The network in this project has a low number of parameters and can be trained on a CPU in <10 minutes. Train on a low 
resolution such as the default 32^3 and visualize at a higher resolution 64-256^3. Be careful with visualizations at 256^3 resolution, memory can run out quickly.

### Prerequisites
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Basic Usage
With each of the following commands the generated voxels are visualized in the browser.

Generate voxel shapes with a CPPN to encode with another network.
On the first run this will generate coordinate datasets and may take awhile.
```
python newshape.py 
```
Train the CPPN-like neural network to encode the generated shapes, takes <10 minutes on CPU.
```
python net.py --op train
```
Run the trained network on a specific latent vector. Default is 0 for the first latent vector.
```
python run.py
```
Run the trained network and traverse the latent space.
```
python net.py --op latent
```
